# autoconnect
A little script I'm working on to get my computer to automatically detect known network sources and connect -- and to connect to hotspot if nothing is available.
Right now, the attempt to kill the script once a result is achieved isn't working. This is --so far-- the only thing I can noticebly tell isn't working properly.
